# Pointer & Swap – Understanding & and *

This C program demonstrates how to use pointers to directly access and modify variables in memory.
It introduces the concepts of the address-of operator (&) and the dereference operator (*), and shows how to swap two variables using a function.

## Concept / Requirement

Learn the difference between:

`&` → "address of"

`*` → "dereference" (access the value at an address)

Pass variables by reference (via pointers) into a function.

Swap the values of two variables inside the function.

Print both the values and the memory addresses before and after the swap.

## Example Input / Output

```pgsql
Variable x (5) is located at location: 0x7ffc8b3a6c34
Variable y (10) is located at location: 0x7ffc8b3a6c38
Variable x (10) is located at location: 0x7ffc8b3a6c34
Variable y (5) is located at location: 0x7ffc8b3a6c38
```


(Note: Memory addresses will vary each time you run the program.)
