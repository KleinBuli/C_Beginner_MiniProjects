# Bubble Sort in C

This beginner-friendly C program demonstrates Bubble Sort, a simple sorting algorithm.
It shows how to use arrays, pointers, and functions to sort integers in ascending order.

## Concept / Requirement

Understand how Bubble Sort works: repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.

Use a swap function with pointers to exchange values.

Pass the array and its size to the sorting function.

Print the sorted array.

## Hint

Define a function `void bubbleSort(int arr[], int size) {}` in which the array size is passed as a parameter.

## Example Output
Example array: `{5, 2, 7, 659, 236, 93, 20, 3, 4}`
```pgsql
2 3 4 5 7 20 93 236 659
```
