# Student Struct Input

This beginner-friendly C program demonstrates how to use structs in C to store and display information about a student.
It allows the user to input the student's name, age, and GPA and then prints the information back.

## Concept / Requirement

Define a Student struct using typedef with the following fields:

`name` (string, may include spaces)

`age` (integer)

`gpa` (float)

Ask the user to enter each field.

Use fgets to safely read the name including spaces.

Use scanf to read numeric values (age and gpa).

Display the entered student information clearly.

Input validation is #NOT necessary. 

## Example Input / Output

```yaml
Enter name: John Doe
Enter age: 20
Enter average: 1.7

Student info:
Name: John Doe
Age: 20
Average: 1.70
```
