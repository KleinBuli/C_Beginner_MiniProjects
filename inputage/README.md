# Input Age / Input without Spaces

This is a simple beginner-friendly C program that demonstrates input validation and basic console interaction. The goal is to practice reading user input safely and handling invalid input.

## Concept / Requirement

Ask the user to enter their age.

Validate the input: it must be a non-negative integer.

If the input is invalid, prompt the user again until a valid number is entered.

After a valid age is entered, display it back to the user.

Use functions to structure the code and make it reusable.

## Example Input / Output
```pgsql
Enter your age: -3
Please enter a valid integer!
Enter your age: abc
Please enter a valid integer!
Enter your age: 25
You are 25 years old.
```
